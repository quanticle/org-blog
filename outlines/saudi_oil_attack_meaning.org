* Summary
+ We take precision for granted in modern warfare, but true precision strike capability requires sophisticated infrastructure
+ Targeting and intelligence is even more important than having precise weapons
+ Without targeting, you get "precise misses" like the Indian airstrikes in Balakot
  + Weapons precisely hit the coordinates they are given
  + However, the coordinates are simply wrong
+ The Saudi Air Force, despite being armed with be best in precision-guided munitions that the West can sell, has /not/ mastered precision warfare
+ Many of the more egregious instances of mass civilian casualties in Yemen stem from Saudi incompetence rather than cruelty
  + Poor targeting
  + Insufficient intelligence
  + Lack of training and familiarity with weapons systems
+ In contrast, the 09/14 attacks on Saudi Arabia demonstrated significant precision, even though they were carried out with much lower-end weapons systems
+ Precision resulted from much better surveillance and targeting prior to attack
  + Attacker did not hit random portions of the oil facility -- targets were carefully chosen to maximize the damage inflicted
  + Flaring and pipeline fires elsewhere along the Saudi coastline indicate significant second-order effects
+ It's /possible/ that the Houthis would have had the necessary expertise to know which targets to hit -- Yemen does have some smaller refineries which are under Houthi control
+ It's /certain/ that the Iranian government has the necessary expertise to know which targets to hit
+ Each individual target was hit very precisely -- can see in satellite images that storage tanks hundreds of meters apart were hit in exactly the same way
+ Suggests that GPS guidance was used
+ Also indicates that the attacker had access to detailed, high resolution imagery tagged with geospatial metadata
+ This imagery was likely provided by a third party with access to sophisticated space-based ISR
  + Has to be either Russia or China
  + Probably Russia, because China has relatively few incentives to cause oil prices to spike
+ Iran may have reappropriated data that was shared with it by Russia (as part of Iran's shared efforts with Russia in Syria) without Russian knowledge
+ Just as significant as the attack was the fact that Saudi Arabia was completely unable to defend against it
+ Saudi Arabia has an entire arm of its military dedicated to air defense -- they were still caught with their pants down
+ The above evidence indicates that the adversary has the following capabilities
  + Precision weapons and delivery mechanisms
  + Ability to carry out long term "effects based" planning -- adversary has enough planning, analysis and intelligence gathering resources to know how to work backwards from desired effects to targets
  + Ability to pick and choose weapons systems in order to inflict desired effects on the target
  + Stealth, or at least the ability to evade Saudi air defenses
+ For all of these reasons, we should suspect the Iranian state rather than the Houthis
+ We can also posit the backing (possible unknowing) of great power like Russia
+ Clear evidence that the gap between Western militaries and second-tier powers is narrowing when it comes to precision strike
+ Western militaries have gotten used to air-supremacy -- Western ground units don't worry about being attacked from the air
+ While Western aircraft are still superior, it's increasingly possible to get the same effects as airstrikes using drones, cruise missiles and conventionally armed ballistic missiles

* My thoughts
+ I agree with many of the conclusions of the piece, but I think it overstates Saudi competence and understates the possibility of human intelligence
+ I think it's more likely that the Iranians got their targeting data from HUMINT assets rather than satellite imagery
  + Iran has a long record of using relatively cheaper HUMINT as a way of equalling adversaries' superior ELINT capabilities
  + As Westerners, we need to be careful of the mode of thinking where we say, "This is how *we* would have done ~X~, therefore it is how our adversaries accomplished ~X~"
+ Overstatement of Saudi competence
  + I don't think you need to do anything special to evade Saudi air defenses
  + Air defense operators were probably (literally) asleep at their consoles
  + Saudi military is primarily used for prestige, nepotism and sinecures
  + Only has been called upon to act as a fighting force very recently, and it shows
  + Saudis are well equipped, but don't have the doctrine or training to use any of their equipment effectively -- the article itself points this out
  + Saudis are more analogous to a Soviet client-state than they are to another US ally like the UK or Israel
+ I do agree that this attack highlights how much convergence there has been in precision-strike capability between Western armed forces and non-Western armed forces
