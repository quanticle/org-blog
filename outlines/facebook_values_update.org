+ Facebook updated its community standards in a short easy-to-miss blog post
+ Written by Monika Bickert, VP of global policy management
+ 4 values which can justify limiting expression
  + Authenticity
  + Safety
  + Privacy
  + Dignity
+ Prioritization of "voice" as the overarching community value
+ Purpose of "voice" is to build community and bring world closer together
+ Explicit incorporation of international human rights standards
+ Why now?
  + Values serve as standards for new oversight board
  + These values serve as a commitment by Facebook that it will abide by the decisions of the board
+ Effects
  + Values guide oversight board in giving feedback on community standards
  + Values act as a "Constitution" for Facebook
  + Interesting that Facebook prioritizes "voice" over other values
  + Facebook is indicating that it will err on the side of leaving content up in ambiguous situations
  + Does not mean that Facebook is turning into a First Amendment fundamentalist organization
  + "Authenticity" requirement means that anonymous content is not allowed
  + Facebook is acknowledging that it is a global corporation, and that other countries have speech standards that differ considerably from the US
  + Notable that Facebook is incorporating global human-rights standards into its values -- gets in front of activists which have been demanding that all social media firms incorporate these standards
+ Community standards realism
  + None of these changes are technically or legally binding
  + Values themselves are very fuzzy and leave a lot of room for interpretations
  + However, the purpose of the values and the oversight board is to give Facebook's decisions greater public legitimacy
  + Facebook is indicating that it thinks this legitimacy matters
  + We should work to hold Facebook accountable to its values
