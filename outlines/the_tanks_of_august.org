    + Post-war establishment of Russian bases inside Abkhazia and South Ossetia
    + Russian and Allied losses during the war
+ Above and beyond the specifics of the Russo-Georgian war, the book focuses on and analyzes the probable nature of military operations in the post-Cold War world
  + Politically, the war pitted the Russian federation, the successor to the Soviet Union against the new Republic of Georgia
  + Russia perceived genuinely severe threats to its national security because the dissolution of the Soviet Union deprived it of strategic depth in key areas
  + The newly formed Republic of Georgia seemed determined to sieze the territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, without consulting either the inhabitants of those regions or the Russian Federation
  + The nature and conduct of the war closely resembles the Arab-Israeli war of 1967
    + Israel absorbed an Arab first strike, and the counterattacked and routed the Arab states in just six days
    + Similarly, Russia absorbed a Georgian first strike, and then routed Georgian forces in just five days
    + Just like Israel seized the Golan Heights, the Russians seized Abkhazia and South Ossetia and granted them independence
    + Just like the Six-Day War presented a new IDF, capable of taking on the combined strength of its Arab neighbors, the Russo-Georgian war presented a new Russian Army, capable of holding its own against more modern opponents

* Georgian Army Reform Under Saakashvili Prior To The 2008 Five Day War

** Brief History of the Georgian Army Since 1991
+ Georgian Army was born when Georgia was still part of the Soviet Union
+ December 20, 1990 -- Georgian authorities announced the formation of a "National Guard"
+ April 30, 1991 -- Georgian authorities start recruiting for National Guard
+ In the early '90s, the National Guard consisted of volunteers, often with no formal higher military education
+ Suffered from lack of training and poor discipline
+ Was eventually incorporated into the Ministry of Defense, but that incorporation was still its early stages at the end of the 1992-1993 war in Abkhazia
+ Ministry of Defense was created in 1992, well after Georgia's declaration of independence
+ 11th brigade (1st brigade of the 1st corps) was created in the spring of 1992
+ Other formations that took part in the 1992 war with Abkhazia were the 23rd Mechanized Infantry Brigade of the 2nd corps and various law enforcement agencies from the Interior Ministry
+ Other (para)military forces fielded by Georgia in 1992 were:
  + Non-governmental paramilitary formations (most notably the Mkhedrioni militia)
  + Zviadi militia, loyal to Georgia's deposed first president Zviad Gamaskhurdia
  + These forces had even greater problems with indiscipline than the Georgian military
  + Zviadi militia actually staged a mutiny against the Georgian military in the last days of the defense of Sukhumi
+ The Georgian military, during the 1992 Abkhazian war, suffered from lack of unified military command, which prevented it from being able to concentrate forces where they were needed
+ Also suffered from indisciplined commanders, who were more eager to find glory than follow orders
+ After the initial defeat in Abkhazia, the Georgian state stepped up the reform of its military
  + Brought paramilitary groups to heel
  + Zviadi loyalists were crushed
  + Mkhedrioni militia was disbanded
  + Other non-govermental militias were brought under (partial) government control
  + National Guard's remit was shrunk to that of a reserve training force
+ The speed of this reform process was held back by a number of limitations
  + Meager funding
    + Low pay for officers and enlisted soldiers
    + No budget for maintenance or modernization
  + Pervasive corruption
  + Uncertain loyalties of Adjarian leader Aslan Abashidze
+ However, there were a number of positive changes in the Georgian military and government
  + Growing foreign military assistance, most notably the United States' 64m dollar Georgia Train and Equip program (GTEP) 
    + Money was used to train the 1st Infantry Brigade (formerly 11th brigade)
    + Also bought training and equipment for a number of other formations
    + In addition, GTEP allowed Georgian officers to attend schools and training programs outside of Georgia, allowing them to professionalize
  + In addition to training and money, the Georgian military also received direct transfers of military equipment from foreign powers
    + Received 10 UH-1 helicopters from the US
    + Received L29 trainer jets from Ukraine
    + Received a Project 206MR fast attack missile boat from Ukraine
+ On the whole, the Georgian military had begun to reform and modernize under Shevardnadze, and that process only accelerated under Saakahsvili

** Georgian Army Priorities Under Saakashvili
+ Saakashvili was elected in 2003, and immediately promulgated a number of documents spelling out the priorities for Army reform
  + National Security Concept
  + Threat Assessment Document
  + National Military Strategy
  + Strategic Defense Review
  + Defense Minister's Vision
+ The National Security Concept outlined the following priorities and challenges:
  + Priorities:
    + Territorial integrity
    + Stability in the Caucasus and Black Sea region
    + Secure a role for Georgia as a transit corridor
  + Challenges:
    + Threats to territorial integrity from Abkhazia and South Ossetia
    + Spread of armed conflict from the Russian North Caucasus
    + Military aggression from other states (considered unlikely) or from non-state actors (considered more likely)
    + Terrorist attacks against key infrastructure and locations, such as pipelines and embassies
    + Contraband and organized crime
    + Short-term threat from Russian bases on Georgian soil, pending their withdrawal
+ The Threat Assessment Document and National Military Strategy contained much the same priorities and challenges
+ However the National Military Strategy also highlighted the Russian peacekeepers in Abkhazia and South Ossetia as a potential threat
+ By 2007 the completion of Russian withdrawal from military bases in Georgia led a lowering of the assessment of the threat for large scale aggression in the Strategic Defense Review of that year
+ The 2007 SDR laid out the following threat picture:
  + Large-scale aggression against Georgia (unlikely)
  + Renewal of hostilities in the breakaway autonomies
  + Spread of conflict from the North Caucasus
  + Spread of conflict from the South Caucasus
  + International terrorism
+ Military planning was carried out with an eye towards which threats were the most likely and which threats would have the largest impact
  + From 2007 to 2012, renewal of hostilities in the breakaway autonomies was seen as the most likely threat and large-scale aggression was seen as the most dangerous
  + From 2013 to 2015, international terrorism was seen as the most likely threat, and the spread of conflict from the North Caucasus as the most dangerous
  + The 2007 SDR anticipated that the conflict over Abkhazia and South Ossetia would have been settled by 2012, and that both provinces would have been reintegrated into Georgia
  + Another assumption was the Georgia would have become a NATO member by 2012, making the country safe from large-scale military aggression
+ Although large-scale aggression from a foreign power (i.e. Russia) was seen as unlikely, preparations for such a scenario were a key part of Georgia's military planning
+ In addition, NATO membership was seen as a bulwark against such aggression, as Georgia's ability to fend off such aggression were questionable
+ In order to make Georgia more attractive as a NATO member, Georgia wished to integrate with NATO standards and make its military able to fight in NATO missions outside of Georgia
  + Doing so went against the need for operational self-sufficiency
  + The difficulty this contradiction posed was compounded by the limited resources available
  + Participation in NATO missions meant that Georgia had to reconfigure its armed forces into a relatively small, professional, lightly armed force
  + Sending troops on foreign missions meant diverting resources from other military programs
+ However, in order to face Abkhazia and South Ossetia, Georgia needed a large force, able to overmatch separatist forces in a classic or counterinsurgency clash
+ In addition, preparations for defending against large scale aggression called for a large professional army, lots of heavy weapons, a large and well-trained reserve, and ancillary equipment (such as air-defense systems) that would be superfluous on NATO missions
+ As a result, the Georgian military strategy called for its army to be able to fight both conventionally and unconventionally
+ Georgian military strategy called for troops to switch to unconventional warfare as they were overrun, rather than retreat
  + Small size of country meant that there were few places to retreat to
  + Past experience indicated that territory, once lost, was not easily regained
  + The best way to deter an adversary was thought to be create a situation which would require high losses for uncertain chances of success
+ Overall, the National Military Strategy (NMS)
